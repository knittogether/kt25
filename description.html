                Great research arises out of amazing collaborations. However, establishing collaborations takes work and
                depends on the context of the institution, the supervision, existing networks, and one's personality.
                With <strong>KnitTogether'25</strong>, we invite NLP researchers, particularly junior ones, for an
                exciting week in the Swiss mountains. While doing hikes and other fun activities, the goal is to get to
                know each other without hurdles, draft ideas, and discuss research. We want to create a safe space where
                everyone can talk openly about their work and ideas without fear of being “judged”, not being able to
                keep up, or being seen as incompetent.
              </p>
              <p>
                In a community that is growing so fast and dealing with a topic that is gaining more and more societal
                influence and relevance, we want to join forces and exchange ideas: what can we learn from each other?
                As the influence of our research in society is increasing due to current developments in our field, we
                would like to take a critical look at the topic of social factors and bias in NLP/AI. Which groups are
                under / over represented or represented to their disadvantage? How can we incorporate such factors into
                modeling? How can we analyze them? We would like to hear the different perspectives of the participants:
                how do they relate their work to the topic. Using innovative and playful methods, we want to learn more
                about the work of our peers and thus get to know each other better “scientifically”.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, we would like to learn something from the topic not only in terms of content but also
                methodologically, preferably from each other: we will have small peer-to-peer tutorials to learn or
                deepen our knowledge on the specific method or tool. And finally, we also want to take a critical look
                at our research and the research in our field on a meta-level. What is important to us? What are the
                "trends" in the research community that we consider to be promising? Where do we feel that something is
                going in a wrong direction? We are planning a series of small group discussions and bar-camps as a way
                of building resonance for our research and a source of new energy and motivation. With
                <strong>KnitTogether</strong>, we want to counter the increasingly fast-paced, publication-focused
                scientific field. Instead of focusing on competition, we want to build an appreciative, mutually
                supportive community.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the second part of the week, we would then like to invite more experienced academics who can give
                concrete feedback on current content-related problems (in an appreciative manner), but from whom we
                would also like to hear a little more from their perspective in general. How do they deal with problems
                in academic work? What tips do they have for reviewing or response periods, for conferences, for reading
                papers, for collaborations? Here, too, we will spend a lot of time exchanging ideas in small groups and
                learning more about each other in an informal and positive context. Of course, there will still be time
                for fun and leisure together, cooking, playing, making music, and enjoying the nature and tranquillity
                of the mountains.
